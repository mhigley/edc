			<p>On any given day at IllumInc, you might find a team critiquing a design, a snoring bulldog, people discussing the potential for a zombie apocalypse and an ample array of animated gifs flowing within HipChat. You’ll also find a team of dedicated designers, strategists, and developers who are generous with ideas, who look beyond the obvious, and always strive to exceed expectations.</p>

			<h2>Enlightened Entrepreneurs</h2>
			<p>ur greatest joys come from watching the evolution of creativity and work. IllumInc is fueled by this daily evolution, experienced and driven by a small team of professionals. We are about the stories we share and the solutions we develop.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>The essence of entrepreneurship is belief.</h2>
			<p>Not just a belief, but the power to believe. It's the power to believe that the world is missing something valuable that only you can give it. Something that makes the world better. Something so valuable that if you don't push past all barriers and bring it to life that the world will fail to progress to its greatest potential, and it will be your fault.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>We respect execution.</h2>
			<p>Getting things done is a process, demands accountability, and has clear goals. Follow through is the most valuable asset to any organization. Successful teams ask questions, evaluate reality, and navigate toward specific solutions. Action implies taking responsibility for results.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>We love technology, but not as much as being human.</h2>
			<p>Our technological society has entered a stage unprecedented in human history. We must remember that technology is not an end-all, it’s a medium. At IllumInc, we believe in making memories, eye contact, and small groups of thoughtful, committed citizens who pursue real-world action.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>We remember the why.</h2>
			<p>It is easy to forsake honesty for programming and forget the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’. When our presentations are intentioned as marketing ploys rather than authentic expression, the why is forsaken.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>We marry form and function.</h2>
			<p>In 1896, American architect Louis Sullivan coined the phrase “form follows function." Decades later, famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright revised Sullivan’s law. Wright said, “Form follows function – that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a sacred union.” At IllumInc, the marriage of form and function is the foundation of our work philosophy.</p>
