		<h3>Dedicated Maintenance team</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>HVAC systems require regular, high-quality maintenance to keep them running at their best. And, should your system go down – whatever the reason – you need to know that someone will be there pretty sharpish to fix it. Our dedicated maintenance team currently looks after in excess of 1000 restaurants across the UK. We have trained call handlers, engineers and project managers available 24 hours a day to help you manage your HVAC system effectively, and support you should anything go wrong.</p>

		<h3>Sustainable restaurant association</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>We’ve been dissatisfied with the level of sustainability in the HVAC industry for a long time now. Filtration far too often consists of non-recyclable filters that sit in the ductwork, clog and become a fire risk, then spend the next umpteen generations clogging up landfill sites. We decided this wasn’t good enough, and developed several sustainable products and systems designed to send almost zero waste to landfill, increase service intervals and maintain high performance levels. Because of this, we were delighted to be named the first HVAC contractor to be listed on the Sustainable Restaurant Association’s approved supplier directory.</p>
